# CMicroWeb
Single header micro web framework in C with templating support

See the `example` directory for example usage.

Based on https://github.com/jeremycw/httpserver.h

## Warning
NOT production ready.
Bodged together in a afternoon.
I don't even know what most of the code in the `httpserver.h` file does.
